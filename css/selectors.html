    <h1> Learning CSS Selectors, color will be aquamarine, bg black and center</h1>
    <p> This is a para, blueviolet, medium and center</p>
    <div> this is div tag with same as p tag</div>
    <section class = "classname"> This is a section with dark green and bold and 6 opacity</section>
    <ul>
        <li> <a href = "#idvalue"> I don't know what I'm doing but lets try </a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>need to have para to check if selector actually works. maybe few more lines. should this be enough? or should I add more lines.I think this will be enough, if not I can come back and add always. let's see. hopefully don't need to as I'm to lazy for this.</p>
    <section id = "idvalue"> lets see if it scrolls down or not</section>
